**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Allows the firm to streamline the entire business operation. Which is practically self-efficient with one staff member who is also the establishment's owner.
**Describe the solution you'd like**
We vet our carriers using commercial products and other software applications. The registration process takes approximately 45 minutes to complete online along with pertinent documents. Carriers can gather all their pertinent documents deemed necessary by The Federal Motor Carriers Safety Administration (FMCSA) and the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT). Participants must follow FMCSA regulations and guidelines. Potential carriers must provide proof of Workmen’s Compensation. Submit documentation of negative drugs and alcohol testing. Potential carriers would apply on the firm’s website. The firm is currently in the process of creating an e-commerce application platform on the site. This process will eventually be phased into 4-part components. The application (APP) will be user-friendly and keep in mind the generational gaps with new technology.
